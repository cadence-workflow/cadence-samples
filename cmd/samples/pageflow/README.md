# Steps to run locally
### `npm install`
Make sure you are running at least node v10 and install dependencies. May take a while for the first time installing these packages.

### `npm start`
This will start the frontend website. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm start-server`
This will start the backend node server. The frontend website will directly communicate with the node server. All traffic will then query a local instance of cadence-server.
