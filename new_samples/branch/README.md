# Branch Sample

## Prerequisites

0. Install Cadence CLI. See instruction [here](https://cadenceworkflow.io/docs/cli/).
1. Run the Cadence server:
    1. Clone the [Cadence](https://github.com/cadence-workflow/cadence) repository if you haven't done already: `git clone https://github.com/cadence-workflow/cadence.git`
    2. Run `docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up` to start Cadence server
    3. See more details at https://github.com/uber/cadence/blob/master/README.md
2. Once everything is up and running in Docker, open [localhost:8088](localhost:8088) to view Cadence UI.
3. Register the `cadence-samples` domain:

```bash
cadence --env development --domain cadence-samples domain register
```

Refresh the [domains page](http://localhost:8088/domains) from step 2 to verify `cadence-samples` is registered.

## Steps to run sample

Inside the folder this sample is defined, run the following command:

```bash
go run .
```

This will call the main function in main.go which starts the worker, which will be execute the sample workflow code

## Branch Workflow Sample

This sample demonstrates **parallel activity execution** using Futures.

### Start the Workflow

```bash
cadence --env development \
  --domain cadence-samples \
  workflow start \
  --tl cadence-samples-worker \
  --et 60 \
  --workflow_type cadence_samples.BranchWorkflow
```

### Key Concept: Parallel Execution with Futures

```go
var futures []workflow.Future
for i := 1; i <= 3; i++ {
    future := workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, BranchActivity, input)
    futures = append(futures, future)
}
// Wait for all
for _, f := range futures {
    f.Get(ctx, nil)
}
```
